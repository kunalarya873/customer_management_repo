Customer Management System
==========================

This project is a simple web application that allows users to create customers by submitting their information through a form. The application is built with a backend API using Django and a frontend UI built with React.

### Features:

*   Create customers by providing their name, email, and address.
*   Display the ID of the newly created customer upon successful submission.
*   Backend handles customer creation and validation.

* * *

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1\. **Clone the Repository**

Clone the project repository to your local machine.

`git clone <repository_url>`

`cd <repository_directory>` 

### 2\. **Backend Setup (Django)**

Make sure you have Python 3.x and Django installed. If not, you can install Python and then install Django:

`pip install django` 

#### Create and Apply Migrations:

Run the following commands to apply database migrations:

`python manage.py makemigrations`

`python manage.py migrate` 

#### Running the Django Development Server:

To run the backend, use the following command:

`python manage.py runserver` 

This will start the Django server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### 3\. **Frontend Setup (React)**

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

#### Install Dependencies:

Inside the frontend directory (`frontend/`), install all the required dependencies:

`cd frontend`

`npm install` 

#### Running the React Development Server:

To run the frontend, use the following command:

`npm start` 

This will start the React server at `http://localhost:3000/`.

API Endpoint
------------

The backend provides a REST API endpoint for creating customers.

### **POST /api/customers/**

**Request Body:**

`{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "address": "123 Main St, Anytown, USA"
}` 

**Response:**

`{
  "id": "12345"
}` 

If the request is invalid or if required fields are missing, the backend will return a `400` status code with an error message:

`{
  "message": "All fields are required"
}` 

* * *

Frontend Workflow
-----------------

*   The frontend has a simple form where users can input the customer’s name, email, and address.
*   Upon form submission, a POST request is sent to the backend with the customer data.
*   If successful, the new customer’s ID is displayed on the frontend.
*   If an error occurs (missing fields or server error), an error message is shown.

* * *

Technology Stack
----------------

*   **Frontend**: React
*   **Backend**: Django
*   **Database**: SQLite (default for Django, can be configured to use other databases)
*   **API**: Django REST Framework (for API creation)
*   **Form Handling**: React with Fetch API to make POST requests

* * *

Development
-----------

### 1\. **Running Both Servers Simultaneously**:

To run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously during development:

*   Run the Django server (`python manage.py runserver`).
*   Run the React server (`npm run dev`).

Make sure to configure the frontend to make requests to the correct backend API endpoint (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/customers/`).

### 2\. **Build and Deploy**

*   Once you're ready to deploy, build the frontend using the following command:

`npm run build` 

*   Configure Django to serve the static files generated by React (you may want to set up a production-ready web server like Nginx or use Django's `django.contrib.staticfiles`).

* * *

Troubleshooting
---------------

*   **CORS Issues**: If you face CORS errors when making requests from React to Django, you may need to install and configure [django\-cors\-headers](https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/).
*   **Backend Error**: If there's an issue in the backend, check Django logs or print the exception details in the views for further debugging.
